The Hospital Queue Management System is an automated solution designed to streamline patient ticket generation, payment processing, and doctor appointment management in hospitals. The system allows patients to generate tickets for medical services, manage their queue positions, and see doctors after completing payments via integrated platforms like M-Pesa. Built using Python for the backend, the system leverages various libraries and frameworks to handle business logic, database interactions, and payment integrations. For the frontend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to ensure an accessible and responsive user interface. The payment processing is seamlessly integrated with M-Pesa APIs, allowing patients to pay conveniently. This system offers a smooth and efficient experience for both hospital staff and patients, reducing wait times and enhancing overall service delivery.
